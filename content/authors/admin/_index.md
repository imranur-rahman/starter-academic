<!-- I am a software engineer in Wearable eXperience Group at Samsung Research. My primary focus is to take care of the overall Media Capture and Playback pipeline of Chromium Engine. Apart from that I am also working on the optimation of the Recommendation Engine of Samsung. I am always involved in competetive programming contests and different idea contests.

I am primarily interested in real-world security and privacy threats in emerging technologies and resource-limited systems such as embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. I am interested in finding out the challenges with the emergence of these devices and building protocols, models, and systems to address those challenges. -->

I am a first-year PhD student at NC State University. The main focus of my research interest is Software Supply Chain Security related problems. I am currently working with [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/) on (a) the mapping of security metrics among different frameworks and (b) the scientific validation of security metrics from different frameworks in Software Supply Chain Security.

Here is a link to my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptPIP4AOqjKdp4rpFvo38SjabVXeYS5e/view?usp=share_link).

<!-- {{% callout note %}}
I am going to start my PhD in Computer Science at [*NC State*](https://www.ncsu.edu/) from Fall '22. I am very excited to start working on cutting edge security and privacy problems.
