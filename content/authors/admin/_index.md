I am a software engineer in Wearable eXperience Group at Samsung Research. My primary focus is to take care of the overall Media Capture and Playback pipeline of Chromium Engine. Apart from that I am also working on the optimation of the Recommendation Engine of Samsung. I am always involved in competetive programming contests and different idea contests.

I am primarily interested in real-world security and privacy threats in emerging technologies and resource-limited systems such as embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. I am interested in finding out the challenges with the emergence of these devices and building protocols, models, and systems to address those challenges.

Here is a link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sEUC0dLiOi8y3A-oai1sDZulgsflvO_5/view?usp=sharing)
